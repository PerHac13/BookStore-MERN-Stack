# Book Store 

***Welcome to Book Store!***

This is a simple web application I built using the MERN Stack, showcasing my skills in both backend development and API handling. The project helped me gain a grasp of backend concepts and how to build and manage APIs effectively.

****The application itself is built with:****

- **React** and **Tailwind:** for a clean and user-friendly frontend experience.
- **Node.js** and **Express.js:** for a robust and scalable backend.
- **MongoDB:** for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Key Features:
- **C**reate:  Add new books to the store.
- **R**ead:   See details of all books in the store.
- **U**pdate: Change the details of existing books.
- **D**elete: Remove books from the store.
